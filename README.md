A Docker container for OpenVAS 8 on the Ubuntu 14.04 image.  By default, the latest images includes the OpenVAS Base as well as the NVTs and Certs required to run OpenVAS.

Requirements
------------
Docker
Ports available: 443, 9390, 9391

Usage
-----

Simply run:

```
docker run -d -p 443:443 -p 9390:9390 -p 9391:9391 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas
```

This will grab the container from the docker registry and start it up.  Openvas startup can take some time (4-5 minutes while NVT's are scanned and databases rebuilt), so be patient.  Once you see a `gasd` process in the top command below, the web ui is good to go.  Goto `https://<machinename>`

```
Username: admin
Password: openvas
```

To check the status of the process, run:

```
docker top openvas
```

In the output, look for the process scanning cert data.  It contains a percentage.

To run bash inside the container run:

```
docker exec -it openvas bash
```

Config
------
By default GSAD will run on 443 with self signed certs.  If you would like to run
this on 80 without certs you can pass the following param and change the port in
docker run from 443 to 80

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 9390:9390 -p 9391:9391 -e HTTP_ONLY=true  --name openvas mikesplain/openvas
```
